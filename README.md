# scriptalert.py
*Automatic notification when your code is done running*  
checks for input process ids every 60 seconds  
can run for as many processes as you want  
sends an SMS text notification when each process is finished  
currently uses twilio trial to send text so must have trial account info saved as environment variables and number to text must be verified first
